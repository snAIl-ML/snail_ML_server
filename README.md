# SNAIL üêå

## Introduction

SNAIL is a team project conducted by four software developers interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.The MVP of this project consists on: 

"Creating a self-driven car which uses ML for it to take the best decisions (turning right, turning left, drive straight).
The soution will be implemented on a small scale car that will drive itself through a random circuit.
Given a random circuit, we assume that the car keeps a constant speed and that it will face X-degree turns."

SNAIL constitues our Final Project for the Makers Academy Bootcamp. After brainstorming and diagriminh, the MVP was delivered in just 7 days. As software develpers who experienced the same Academy, we all have an inclination to follow Agile principles, Test Driven Development and best practices for Code Quality.

As a team, our areas or focus are:
- Learning process.
- Code writing.
- Team work and use of Agile methodologies.
