# SNAIL üêå

## Introduction

SNAIL is a team project conducted by four software developers interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.The MVP of this project consists on: 

"Creating a self-driven car which uses ML for it to take the best decisions (turning right, turning left, drive straight).
The soution will be implemented on a small scale car that will drive itself through a random circuit.
Given a random circuit, we assume that the car keeps a constant speed and that it will face X-degree turns."

SNAIL constitues our Final Project for the Makers Academy Bootcamp. After brainstorming and diagriming, the MVP was delivered in just 7 days. As software develpers who experienced the same Academy, we all have an inclination to follow Agile principles, Test Driven Development and best practices for Code Quality.

As a team, our areas or focus are:
- Learning process.
- Code writing.
- Team work and use of Agile methodologies.
The Tech Stack used consists of:
- Python.
- TensorFlow.
- Flask. 
- HTML/CSS.


## Criteria üîç  
The criteria followed to self-evaluate the work done is grouped into four sections:
### Tests
* Passes tests.
* 100% test coverage.
* Appropriate feature and isolated unit tests.
### Quality
* Passes pylint.
### Development
* Evidence of git workflow.
* Good documentation of project in the README.md.
* Card wall in order to keep track of tasks and objectives.
### Learning
* Daily reflective blogs.
* Daily stand ups/retrospectives or another technique for group checkins/reflection.
