# SNAIL 🐌

## Introduction

SNAIL is a team project conducted by four software developers interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.The MVP of this project consists on: 

"Creating a self-driven car which uses ML for it to take the best decisions (turning right, turning left, drive straight).
The soution will be implemented on a small scale car that will drive itself through a random circuit.
Given a random circuit, we assume that the car keeps a constant speed and that it will face X-degree turns."

SNAIL constitues our Final Project for the Makers Academy Bootcamp. After brainstorming and diagramming, the MVP was delivered in just 7 days. As software develpers who experienced the same Academy, we all have an inclination to follow Agile principles, Test Driven Development and best practices for Code Quality.

As a team, our areas or focus are:
- Learning process.
- Code writing.
- Team work and use of Agile methodologies.

The Tech Stack used consists of:
- Python.
- TensorFlow.
- Flask. 
- HTML/CSS.


## Criteria 🔍  
The criteria followed to self-evaluate the work done is grouped into four sections:
### Tests
* Passes tests.
* 100% test coverage.
* Appropriate feature and isolated unit tests.
### Quality
* Passes pylint.
### Development
* Evidence of git workflow.
* Good documentation of project in the README.md.
* Card wall in order to keep track of tasks and objectives.
### Learning
* Daily reflective blogs.
* Daily stand ups/retrospectives or another technique for group checkins/reflection.

## Getting Started 🚴‍

First, clone this repository. Then:

To update your environment after cloning the repository, run the following command on the shell:
```bash
>pip3 install requirements
```
To start the server, run the following command on the shell:
```bash
>python snailMLserver.py # Start the server at localhost:8000
```
You can invoke testing through the Python interpreter from the shell:
```bash
>python -m pytest [...]
```
Run tests in a module from the shell:
```bash
>pytest test_mod.py
```
Run tests in a directory from the shell:
```bash
>pytest testing/
```
Run tests by keyword expressions from the shell:
```bash
>pytest -k "MyClass and not method"
```
To have python linter available, run the following command on the shell:
```bash
>pip install pylint
```
To analyse the code quality of a file, do so as in this example:
```bash
>pylint path_helper_main_ml.py
```
To check the test coverage, run the following command on the shell:
```bash
>py.test --cov test/
```
