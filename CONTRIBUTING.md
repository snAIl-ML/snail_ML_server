# Process for submitting work to this project

* Open a ticket in the trello card wall.
* Make a branch and work on that branch.
* When the feature is complete and the tests are passing, make a PR and move the ticket to QA.
* Branches must get approval before they merge the code - a dev can give one squirrel:
  * The expectation is you give an approval if you understand how the code works and think it's of good quality.
  * Try to use a PR as a knowledge-sharing ground:
    - Write an informative description of what the PR changes, link it to a ticket for more information.
    - Discuss bits of code on the PR before approving.
* Once code is merged into master, move the ticket into 'Done' only once it is successfully in production.
